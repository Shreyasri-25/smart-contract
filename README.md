Voting Contract - Solidity Smart Contract
This is a Solidity smart contract for a simple voting system. It allows users to cast votes for candidates, with optional voting fees. The contract also includes access control for modifying the minimum voting fee.

Features:

Cast votes for candidates.
Optional voting fees (configurable by owner).
Prevents double voting by the same user.
Access control for setting minimum voting fee (only owner).
Deployment:

Compile the contract using a Solidity compiler.
Deploy the contract to your preferred blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum).
Set the initial owner address during deployment using the constructor.
Usage:

Users can call the castVote function with the address of the candidate they are voting for.
If a voting fee is required, the user needs to send the required amount of ether along with the transaction.
Anyone can call the getVotes function with the address of a candidate to retrieve their current vote count.
Only the owner can call the setMinimumVoteFee function to adjust the minimum required voting fee (cannot be negative).
Error Handling:

The contract utilizes revert statements to handle errors. These provide informative messages about the issue encountered.

Important Note:

This is a basic implementation for demonstration purposes. Consider security best practices and additional features for production use cases.

Security Considerations:

This implementation does not include any access control for casting votes (anyone can vote for any candidate).
Consider adding voter registration or authentication depending on your specific requirements.
Review and understand potential vulnerabilities associated with user-controlled data (e.g., candidate addresses).
Further Development:

Implement voter registration or authentication.
Add support for multiple candidates.
Implement vote closing and result retrieval functionalities.
This README file provides a basic overview of the voting contract. Remember to adapt and extend it based on your specific use case and security requirements.
